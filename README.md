# Calculus Knowledge Assessment

**Assessment must be open-source.** When we ask our students to pay a
publisher to get their homework graded, we are not only asking them to
pay for points---we are also outsourcing our core mission.
Furthermore, the most engaged students will want to dig into the guts
of the assessment platform, necessitating that our students can "open
the hood" and look inside the assessment platform.  For more on the
underlying philosophy, see *[An Open Perspective on Interactive
Textbooks](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2016/8/an-open-perspective-on-interactive-textbooks)*.

The *Calculus Knowledge Assessment* is a bank of multiple-choice
calculus questions openly licensed
([CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode))
so that they can be used as broadly as possible.  With its goal of
being a *large* bank of questions, the CKA bank is designed so that
the easiest way for students to memorize the answers is simply to
understand the underlying concepts.

The *Math Education Forum* at Ohio State is currently drafting a paper
detailing the CKA, measured learning gains in calculus, etc.  If you
are interested in collaborating (either by contributing questions,
providing expert feedback, or working on the data), please contact
