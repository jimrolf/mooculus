\begin{problem}
  Suppose whenever $x$ is very large, $f(x)$ is close to 1.  What is true about $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The graph of $f$ does not cross the line $y = 1$.}
    \choice{The graph of $f$ does not cross the line $x = 1$.}
    \choice{Whenever $x$ is close to zero, $f(1/x)$ is close to 1.}
    \choice[correct]{Whenever $x$ is very large, $f(x^2)$ is close to 1.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
