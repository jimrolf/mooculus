\begin{problem}
  Suppose $a$ and $b$ and $A$ and $B$ are very large, positive numbers, and suppose $A > a$ and $B < b$.  How does $A/B$ compare to $a/b$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{$A/B$ is bigger than $a/b$}
    \choice{$A/B$ is equal to $a/b$}
    \choice{$A/B$ is smaller than $a/b$}
    \choice{It could be that $A/B$ or $a/b$ is larger}
  \end{multipleChoice}
