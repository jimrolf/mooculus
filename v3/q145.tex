\begin{problem}
  Suppose the slope of a tangent line to the graph of $f$ at the point $x$ is $x \cdot f(x)$ and suppose $f(0) = 1$.  What must be true of $f$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{By choosing $x$ large enough, $f(x)$ can be made as large as desired}
    \choice{By choosing $x$ large enough, $f(x)$ can be made as close to zero as desired}
    \choice{By choosing $x$ large enough, $f(x)$ can be made as negative as desired}
  \end{multipleChoice}
