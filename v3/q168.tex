\begin{problem}
  Suppose $f$ is a continuous function.  Consider $g(n) = \int_0^1 f(x^n) \, dx$.  When $n$ is very large, what is a good guess as to the value of $g(n)$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{When $n$ is large, $g(n)$ is close to $f(0)$}
    \choice{When $n$ is large, $g(n)$ is close to $f(1)$}
    \choice{When $n$ is large, $g(n)$ is close to the average value of $f$ on the interval $[0,1]$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
