	Let $f$ and $g$ be two functions satisfying the relationship $f(5x) = g(x)$.  Suppose the point $(1,2)$ is on the graph of $f$.
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice{The point $(5, 2)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice{The point $(5, 10)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice{The point $(\frac{1}{5}, 10)$ is on the graph of $g$}
		\choice[correct]{The point $(\frac{1}{5},2)$ is on the graph of $g$}
	\end{multipleChoice}
