\begin{problem}
  Suppose $A$ and $a$ differ by at most $2$ and suppose $B$ and $b$
  differ by at most $1$.  In symbols, this means that $|A - a| < 2$ and $|B - b| < 1$.
  By how much could $A/B$ and $a/b$ differ?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{By no more than $1$, meaning $|A/B - a/b| < 1$}
    \choice{By no more than $2$, meaning $|A/B - a/b| < 2$}
    \choice{By no more than a factor of $2$, meaning $\left| \frac{A/B}{a/b} \right| < 2$}
    \choice{By no more than a factor of $1/2$, meaning $\left| \frac{A/B}{a/b} \right| < \frac{1}{2}$}
    \choice[correct]{By any amount}
  \end{multipleChoice}
