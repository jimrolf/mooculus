A team in the Ohio State math department is studying the effectiveness
of our calculus courses, and \textbf{we need your help.}  To measure
what is being learned over the course of the semester, we will offer
two online assessments.

You are not expected to study for these assessments.  Between today
and the deadline, you should complete this online test.  It will take
about 20 minutes and should be completed in one sitting.

Many of the ``conceptual'' questions on the exam may be new and you
may not know how to solve them; this is by design.  Your responses
will help us improve in the future.

To move on to the next question, click the ``Next'' button below.  You
may make as many attempts as you like for each problem.
