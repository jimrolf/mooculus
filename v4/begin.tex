A team in the Ohio State math department is studying the effectiveness
of our calculus courses, and \textbf{we need your help.}  To measure
what is being learned over the course of the semester, we will offer
two online assessments.

You are not expected to study for these assessments.  Between today
and the deadline, you should complete this online post-test.  It will
take about 20 minutes and should be completed in one sitting.

Many of the ``conceptual'' questions on the exam may be new and you
may not know how to solve them; this is by design.  Your responses
will help us improve in the future.  Please try your best to answer
the questions until the Progress Bar is filled in.
