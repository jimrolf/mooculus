\begin{problem}

  The graph of the position of an object with respect to time is given
  by a straight line with a positive slope.  What can we say about the
  acceleration of the object?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{It is positive.}
    \choice{It is negative.}
    \choice[correct]{It is zero.}
    \choice{The acceleration changes from negative to positive.}
    \choice{We cannot say anything about the sign of the acceleration.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
