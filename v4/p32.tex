\begin{problem}

  Suppose $f$ and $g$ are increasing functions with domain consisting of all real numbers.  What can be said about the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{It is a decreasing function.}
    \choice{It is a constant function.}
    \choice[correct]{It is an increasing function.}
    \choice{It depends on exactly which functions $f$ and $g$ are being considered.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
