\begin{problem} 

  Pick two numbers positve real numbers $a$ and $b$ so that
  $a \approx b$.  Pick a very large integer $N$.  What can you say
  about $a^N$ and $b^N$?
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$a^N$ and $b^N$ must both be large because $N$ is large.}
    \choice{$a^N$ and $b^N$ must both be small because $|a-b|^N$ is small.}
    \choice{$a^N$ must be very close to $b^N$ because $a \approx b$.}
    \choice[correct]{$a^N$ might not be very close to $b^N$ even though $a \approx b$.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
